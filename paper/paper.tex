\begin{abstract}
We propose a Bayesian approach for functional linear or logistic  regression models, based on the theory of Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS's). These new models build upon the RKHS associated with the covariance function of the underlying stochastic process, and can be viewed as a finite-dimensional approximation to the classical functional regression paradigm. The corresponding functional model (or the functional logistic equation in the case of binary response) is determined by a function living on a dense subset of the RKHS generated by the underlying covariance function. By imposing a suitable prior distribution on such RKHS, we can perform data-driven inference via standard Bayes methodology. The posterior distribution can be approximated from Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Several estimators derived from this posterior distribution turn out to be competitive against other usual  alternatives in both simulated examples and real data sets, including a Bayesian-motivated variable selection method.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

The problem of predicting a scalar response from a functional covariate is one that has gained traction over the last few decades, as more and more data is being generated with an ever-increasing level of granularity in the measurements. While in principle we could simply regard the functional data as a discretized vector in a very high dimension, there are often many advantages in taking into account the functional nature of the data, ranging from modeling the possibly high correlation among points that are close in the domain, to extracting information that may be hidden in the derivatives of the function in question. As a consequence, numerous proposals have arisen on how to suitably deal with functional data, all of them encompassed under the term Functional Data Analysis (FDA), which essentially explores statistical techniques to process, model and make inference on continuous data. A partial survey on such techniques and methods is \citet{cuevas2014partial}, while a more detailed exposition of the theory and applications can be found for example in \citet{hsing2015theoretical} and \citet{horváth2012inference}.

\end{comment}

In this work we are concerned with functional linear and logistic regression models, that is, situations where the goal is to predict a continuous or dichotomous variable from functional observations. Even though these problems can be formally stated with almost no differences from their finite-dimensional counterparts, there are some fundamental challenges as well as some more subtle drawbacks that emerge as a result of working in infinite dimensions. To set a common framework, throughout this work we will consider a scalar response variable \(Y\) (either continuous or binary) which has some dependence on a stochastic \(L^2\)-process \(X=X(t)=X(t, \omega)\) with trajectories in \(L^2[0, 1]\). We will further suppose without loss of generality that \(X\) is centered, that is, its mean function \(m(t)=\E[X(t)]\) vanishes for all \(t\in[0,1]\). In addition, we will tacitly assume the existence of a ``labeled'' data set \(\mathcal D_n =\{(X_i, Y_i): i=1,\dots, n\}\) of independent observations from \((X, Y)\), and our aim will be to accurately predict the response corresponding to unlabeled samples from \(X\).

\subsubsection{\(L^2\)-models, shortcomings and alternatives}

 The most common functional linear regression model is the classical \(L^2\)-model, widely popularized since the first edition (1997) of the book by~\citet{ramsay2005functional}. It can be seen as a generalization of the usual finite-dimensional model, replacing the scalar product in \(\R^d\) for that of the functional space \(L^2[0,1]\):
\begin{equation}\label{eq:l2-linear-model}
Y = \alpha_0 + \dotprod{X}{\beta} + \epsilon = \alpha_0 + \int_0^1 X(t)\beta(t)\, dt + \epsilon,
\end{equation}
where \(\alpha_0\in \R\), \(\epsilon\) is an error term independent from \(X\) with \(\E [\epsilon]=0\), and the functional slope parameter \(\beta=\beta(\cdot)\) is assumed to be a member of the infinite-dimensional space \(L^2[0, 1]\). In this case, the inference on \(\beta\) is hampered by the fact that \(L^2[0,1]\) is an extremely wide space that contains many non-smooth or ill-behaved functions, so that any estimation procedure involving optimization on it would typically be very hard. In spite of this, model~\eqref{eq:l2-linear-model} is not flexible enough to include ``simple'' finite-dimensional models based linear combinations of the marginals, such as \(Y=\alpha_0 + \beta_1 X(t_1)+ \cdots + \beta_p X(t_p) + \epsilon\) for some constants \(\beta_j\in\R\) and instants \(t_j\in[0,1]\) (see \citet{berrendero2020general} for additional details on this). Moreover, the non-invertibility of the covariance operator associated with \(X\) (defined in Section~\ref{sec:rkhs}), which plays the role of the covariance matrix in the infinite case, invalidates the usual least squares theory.

A similar \(L^2\)-based functional logistic equation can be derived for the binary classification problem via the logistic function:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:l2-logistic-model}
  \mathbb P(Y=1 \mid X) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp\{-\alpha_0 - \dotprod{X}{\beta}\}},
\end{equation}
where \(\alpha_0 \in \R\) and \(\beta \in L^2[0, 1]\). In this situation, the most common way of estimating the slope function \(\beta(\cdot)\) is via its Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE). However, not only do the same complications as in the linear regression model apply in this situation, but there is also the additional problem that in functional settings the MLE does not exist with probability one under fairly general conditions \citep[see][Sec.~3.2]{berrendero2021functional}.

It turns out that in both situations a natural alternative to the \(L^2\)-model is the so-called Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) model, which instead assumes the unknown parameter to be a member of the RKHS associated with the covariance function of the process \(X\), making use of the scalar product of that space. As we will show later on, not only is this model simpler and arguably easier to interpret, but it also constrains the parameter space to smoother and more manageable functions. In fact, it includes a model based on finite linear combinations of the marginals of \(X\) as a particular case, which is particularly appealing to practitioners confronted with functional data problems due to its simplicity. These RKHS-based models and their idiosyncrasies have been explored in \citet{berrendero2019rkhs, berrendero2020general} in the functional linear regression setting, and in \citet{berrendero2018use, berrendero2021functional} for the case of logistic regression.

A major aim of this work is to motivate these recently-proposed models inside the functional framework, while also providing efficient techniques to apply them in practice. Our main contribution is the proposal of a Bayesian approach to parameter estimation within the aforementioned RKHS models, in which a prior distribution is imposed on the unknown functional parameter to obtain a posterior distribution after seeing the data. In this way, one can incorporate pre-existing beliefs about the parameters, thus increasing the flexibility of the estimation procedure. Even though setting a prior distribution on a function space is generally a hard task, the specific parametric formulation of the RKHS models we propose greatly facilitates this (see Section~\ref{sec:methodology} for details). \incomment{Comentar resultados experimentales}

Another set of techniques extensively studied in this context are variable selection methods, which aim to select the marginals \(\{X(t_i)\}\) of the process that better summarize it according to some optimality criterion. As it happens, some variable selection methods have already been proposed in the RKHS framework \citep[see for example][]{berrendero2019rkhs}, but in general they have their own dedicated algorithms and procedures. As will become apparent in the forthcoming sections, given the nature of our suggested Bayesian model we could easily isolate the marginal posterior distribution corresponding to a finite set of points \(\{t_i\}\), and thus provide a Bayesian-motivated variable selection process along with the other prediction methods that naturally arise within our model. In this way, in addition to making predictions about the input data, we could evaluate exactly which marginals of the functional explanatory variable contain the most relevant information. These points-of-impact selection models for functional predictors have also appeared recently in the literature; see \citet{poss2020superconsistent}, \citet{berrendero2016variable} or \citet{ferraty2010most} by way of illustration. \incomment{Comentar resultados experimentales}


\subsubsection{Organization of the paper}

In Section~\ref{sec:rkhs} we review the basics of the theory of RKHS's from a probabilistic point of view. Section~\ref{sec:methodology} is devoted to explaining the Bayesian methodology and the functional regression models we propose. The empirical results of the experimentation are contained in Section~\ref{sec:results}, which also includes a short discussion of computational details. Lastly, the conclusions drawn from this work are presented in Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.

\subsection{Some essentials on RKHS's and notation}\label{sec:rkhs}

The methodology proposed in this work relies heavily on the use of RKHS's, so before diving into it we will briefly describe the main characteristics of these spaces (for a more detailed account, see for example~\citet{berlinet2004reproducing}). In what follows, suppose that the covariance function of \(X\), \(K(t, s)= \mathbb E[X(t)X(s)]\), is continuous. To construct the RKHS \(\Hcal(K)\) associated with the covariance function, we start by defining the functional space \(\Hcal_0(K)\) of all finite linear combinations of evaluations of \(K\), that is,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:h0}
\Hcal_0(K) = \left\{ f \in L^2[0,1]: \ f(\cdot) = \sum_{i=1}^p a_i K(t_i, \cdot), \ p \in \N, \ a_i \in \R, \ t_i \in [0, 1] \right\}.
\end{equation}
This space is endowed with the inner product \(\dotprod{f}{g}_K = \sum_{i, j} a_i b_j K(t_i, s_j)\), given that \(f(\cdot)=\sum_i a_i K(t_i, \cdot) \) and \(g(\cdot)=\sum_j b_j K(s_j, \cdot)\). Then, we define \(\Hcal(K)\) to be the completion of \(\Hcal_0(K)\) under the norm induced by the scalar product defined above. As it turns out, functions in this space verify the \textit{reproducing property} \(\dotprod{K(t, \cdot)}{f}_K = f(t)\) for all \(f \in \Hcal(K)\) and \(t \in [0, 1]\), thus giving it its name. An important detail to note is that, since \(\Hcal(K)\) is a space of genuine functions and not of equivalence classes, the values of these functions at particular points are in fact relevant, unlike in \(L^2\)-spaces.

As we can see, the covariance function of \(X\) (sometimes referred to as the \textit{kernel}) plays a crucial role in characterizing the RKHS. An integral operator closely related to this kernel is the so-called covariance operator, namely \(\mathcal Kf(\cdot) = \int_0^1 K(s, \cdot)f(s)\, ds\) for \(f \in L^2[0, 1]\), which is self-adjoint and compact when \(K\) is continuous \citep[e.g.][Th.~4.6.2]{hsing2015theoretical}. It is worth mentioning that this operator provides several alternative definitions of \(\Hcal(K)\); for example, the RKHS can be identified with the image of the square root of the covariance operator, i.e., \(\Hcal(K) = \mathcal K^{1/2}(L^2[0, 1])\), with inner product \(\dotprod{f}{g}_K = \dotprod{\mathcal K^{-1/2}(f)}{\mathcal K^{-1/2}(g)}\). Furthermore, we can think of the norm in \(\Hcal(K)\) as an \(L^2\)-like regularized norm, since it is easy to show that we can also express \(\Hcal(K) = \{f \in L^2[0, 1]: \ \sum_j \lambda_j^{-1}\dotprod{f}{\phi_j}^2 < \infty \}\), with the corresponding inner product \(\dotprod{f}{g}_K = \sum_j \lambda_j^{-1}\dotprod{f}{\phi_j}\dotprod{g}{\phi_j}\), where in turn \(\lambda_j\) and \(\phi_j\) are the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of \(\mathcal K\), respectively. Note that, since the spectral theorem for compact operators tells us that the sequence of eigenvalues \(\{\lambda_j\}\subset \R^+_0\) tends to zero \citep[e.g.][Th.~4.2.4]{hsing2015theoretical}, this definition highlights the fact that functions in \(\Hcal(K)\) are smooth, in the sense that their components in an orthonormal basis need to vanish quickly.

Lastly, a particularly useful approach in statistics is to regard \(\Hcal(K)\) as an isometric copy of a well-known space. Specifically, via \textit{Loève's isometry} one can establish a congruence between \(\Hcal(K)\) and the linear span of the process, \(\mathcal L(X)\), in the space of all random variables with finite second moment, \(L^2(\Omega)\) (see Lemma 1.1 in \citet{lukic2001stochastic}). This isometry is essentially the completion of the correspondence
  \[
  \sum_{i=1}^p a_i X(t_i) \longleftrightarrow \sum_{i=1}^p a_i K(t_i, \cdot),
\]
and can be formally defined as \(\Psi^{-1}_X(U)(t) = \E[U X(t)]\) for \(U \in \mathcal L(X)\).
Despite the close connection between the process \(X\) and the space \(\Hcal(K)\), special care must be taken when dealing with concrete realizations of the process, since under rather general conditions the trajectories of \(X\) do not belong to the corresponding RKHS with probability one \citep[see for example][Cor.~7.1]{lukic2001stochastic}. As a consequence, the expression \(\dotprod{x}{f}_K\) is ill-defined and lacks meaning when \(x\) is a realization of \(X\). However, following Parzen's approach in his seminal work on time series analysis \citep[Th.~4E]{parzen1961approach}, we can leverage Loève's isometry and identify \(\dotprod{x}{f}_K \) with \( \Psi_x(f) := \Psi_X(f)(\omega)\), for \(x=X(\omega)\) and \(f\in \Hcal(K)\). This notation often proves to be useful and convenient.

\section{Bayesian methodology for RKHS-based functional regression models}\label{sec:methodology}

In this section we present the precise models and Bayesian methodologies explored in this work. The RKHS-based functional models under consideration are those obtained by taking a functional parameter \(\alpha \in \Hcal(K)\) and replacing the scalar product for Loève's isometry \(\dotprod{x}{\alpha}_K\) in the \(L^2\)-models~\eqref{eq:l2-linear-model} and~\eqref{eq:l2-logistic-model}. However, to further simplify things we will follow a parametric approach and suppose that \(\alpha\) is in fact a member of the dense subspace \(\Hcal_0(K)\) defined in~\eqref{eq:h0}. The value of \(p\), the dimensionality of the model, will be fixed beforehand in a suitable way (see Section~\ref{sec:model-choice} for details), and we will regard \(\beta_j\) and \(t_j\) as free parameters. Thus, we will search for our functional parameter in the set
\[
\Hcal_{0,p}(K)=\left\{ \sum_{j=1}^p \beta_j K(t_j, \cdot): \ \beta_1,\dots,\beta_p \in \R, \ t_1,\dots,t_p \in [0, 1]\right\}.
\]

The general idea will be to impose a prior distribution on these free parameters (and possibly others) to eventually derive a posterior model after incorporating the available sample information. \incomment{Una de las cosas difíciles en estadística bayesiana es poner un prior en un espacio de funciones. Una de las ventajas del modelopropuesto (y por el que advocamos por este modelo) es que facilita esta tarea, de manera natural y manejable. Poner una subsubsection con: definición de una priori adecuada en nuestro RKHS framework}In view of expression~\eqref{eq:alpha-parameter-rkhs}, to set a prior distribution on the unknown function \(\alpha\) (that is, a prior distribution on the functional space \(\Hcal_{0,p}(K)\)) it suffices to consider \(p\)-dimensional continuous prior distributions for the coefficients \(\{\beta_j\}\) and the times \(\{t_j\}\) separately. Moreover, as we said before, with a slight abuse of notation we will understand the expression \(\dotprod{x}{\alpha}_K\) as \(\Psi_x(\alpha)\), where \(\Psi\) is Loève's isometry. Hence, taking into account that \(\Psi_X(K(t, \cdot)) = X(t)\) by definition, we have
\[
\dotprod{x}{\alpha}_K \equiv \sum_{j=1}^p \beta_j x(t_j).
\]

To begin with, note that starting from a probability distribution \(\mathbb{P}_0\) on \(\Hcal_0(K)\) we can obtain a probability distribution \(\mathbb{P}\) on \(\Hcal(K)\) simply by defining \(\mathbb{P}(B) = \mathbb{P}_0(B\cap \Hcal_0(K))\) for all Borel sets \(B \in \mathcal B(\Hcal(K))\). This is why our simplifying assumption on \(\alpha\) is not actually very restrictive, since any prior distribution on \(\Hcal_0(K)\) can be directly extended to a prior distribution on \(\Hcal(K)\).

\incomment{Mencionar que en realidad trabajamos en \(H_{0,p}\).}

In any case, after selecting a suitable prior distribution \(\pi(\theta)\) for the parameter vector \(\theta\) on the chosen finite-dimensional parameter space, we can resort to Bayes' theorem to perform the inference step, which in the case of i.i.d. samples amounts to
\begin{equation}\label{eq:bayes-theorem}
  \pi(\theta \mid \mathcal D_n) \propto \left[ \prod_{i=1}^n \pi(Y_i\mid X_i, \theta) \right]\pi(\theta).
\end{equation}
In Sections~\ref{sec:rkhs-linear-model} and~\ref{sec:rkhs-logistic-model} we proceed to specify the parameter spaces, prior distributions and concrete models for \(\pi(Y\mid X,\theta)\) considered in the case of functional linear regression and functional logistic regression, respectively.

\incomment{Disminuir mucho el párrafo de MCMC, simplemente comentarlo de pasada y en todo caso alguna referencia a una survey.}

A last technicality to discuss is the fact that in~\eqref{eq:bayes-theorem} we have omitted the possibly intractable integral related to the normalizing constant. Nevertheless, we can sample from the posterior distribution using an algorithm of the family of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling methods. These are subset of the more general Monte Carlo simulation methods, which are specifically designed to sample from a multi-dimensional distribution when only a function proportional to its density (or its log-density) is known. Generally speaking, these algorithms obtain samples from a continuous random variable by generating Markov chains whose stationary distribution is proportional to the given function. In short, they operate by building stochastic processes of random walkers that travel the parameter space, selecting where to move based on certain criteria that make them more likely to generate samples from the intended distribution. The Metropolis-Hastings algorithm \citep[e.g.][]{chib1995understanding} is arguably the most well-known method in this regard.

\subsection{Functional linear regression}\label{sec:rkhs-linear-model}

In the case of functional linear regression, the RKHS model considered (with a functional parameter \(\alpha\in \Hcal_{0,p}(K)\)) is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:rkhs-model-linear}
  Y = \alpha_0 + \Psi_X(\alpha) + \epsilon = \alpha_0 + \sum_{j=1}^p \beta_j X(t_j) + \epsilon,
\end{equation}
where \(\beta_j \in \R\), \(t_j \in [0, 1]\), \(\alpha_0\in\R\), and \(\epsilon\) is an independent normally-distributed error term verifying \(\E[\epsilon]=0\) and \(\Var(\epsilon)=\sigma^2\in \R^+\). When \(p\) is fixed, the parameter space of dimension \(2p + 2\) becomes \(\Theta_p = \R^p \times [0, 1]^p \times \R \times \R^+\), and note that given the times \(\{t_j\}\) the model becomes a multiple linear model with the \(X(t_j)\) as scalar covariates. Before proceeding any further, observe that we can rewrite model~\eqref{eq:rkhs-model-linear} in a more explicit and practical fashion in terms of the available sample information in \(\mathcal D_n\). For a generic element \(\theta = (\beta_1,\dots, \beta_p, t_1,\dots, t_p, \alpha_0, \sigma^2) \equiv (\beta, \tau, \alpha_0, \sigma^2) \in \Theta_p\), the reinterpreted model assumes the form
\begin{equation}\label{eq:rkhs-model-linear-2}
  Y_i \mid X_i, \theta \ \stackrel{\text{i.i.d.}}{\sim} \mathcal N\left(\alpha_0 + \sum_{j=1}^p \beta_j X_i(t_j), \ \sigma^2\right), \quad i =1,\dots, n.
\end{equation}

It is worth mentioning that the model remains linear in the sense that it fundamentally involves a random variable belonging to the linear span of the process \(X\) in \(L^2(\Omega)\). Furthermore, this RKHS model is particularly suited as a basis for variable selection methods, and also entails the classical \(L^2\)-model~\eqref{eq:l2-linear-model} under certain conditions \citep[see][Sec.~3]{berrendero2020general}. In addition, as far as generalizations go the model is easily extensible, seeing as how several functional covariates belonging to the RKHS could be added. In that case, as argued in \citet{grollemund2019bayesian} for a similar situation, if we were to set a prior distribution on all the parameters involved, we could recover the full posterior by looking alternately at the posterior distribution of each covariate conditional on the rest of them.

The prior distribution \(\pi(\theta)\) suggested for the parameter \(\theta \in \Theta_p\) is given by
\begin{align}\label{eq:prior-linear}
  \begin{split}
  \pi(\alpha_0, \sigma^2)              & \propto 1/\sigma^2,                                                     \\
  \tau                     & \sim \mathcal U([0, 1]^p),                                              \\
  \beta\mid \tau, \sigma^2 & \sim \mathcal N_p(b_0, g\sigma^2(G_\tau + \eta I)^{-1}),
\end{split}
\end{align}
where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(G_\tau = \mathcal X_\tau'\mathcal X_\tau\) is the Gram matrix corresponding to the matrix \(\mathcal X_\tau = (X_i(t_j))_{i,j}\), and \(b_0\in \R^p, \ g \in \R\) and \(\eta \in \R^+\) are hyperparameters of the model. On the one hand, note the use of a joint prior distribution on \(\alpha_0\) and \(\sigma^2\), which is a widely used non-informative prior known as Jeffrey's prior \citep{jeffreys1946invariant}. In any event, the estimation of \(\alpha_0\) is straightforward, since \(\alpha_0 = \E[Y]\) by~\eqref{eq:rkhs-model-linear-2}, so we could have left this parameter out of the model altogether. On the other hand, the prior on \(\beta\) is a slight modification of the well-known Zellner's g-prior \citep{zellner1986assessing} in which a regularizing term is added to avoid ill-conditioning problems in the Gram matrix, obtaining a ridge-like Zellner prior controlled by the tuning parameter \(\eta\) \citep{baragatti2012study}. \incomment{Comentar la distribución a priori en su forma completa, decir que son independientes.}

When performing the empirical posterior approximation, on each of the \(M\) steps of the iterative MCMC algorithm we get an approximate sample \(\theta^{(m)*}\) of the posterior distribution \(\pi(\theta\mid \mathcal D_n)\). Assuming now a previously unseen test set \(\mathcal D'_{n'}\) in the same conditions as \(\mathcal D_n\), we propose to construct three different kinds of estimators based on the MCMC samples: \incomment{Recordemos que el algoritmo nos da una observación del vector de parámetros,y hay varias estrategias para usarlas.}

\begin{description}
  \item[Point estimates] If we consider a point-estimate statistic \(T\) to act as a summary of the posterior distribution, we can get the corresponding estimates \(\hat{\theta}=(\hat \beta, \hat \tau, \hat{\alpha}_0, \hat{\sigma}^2) = T(\{\theta^{(m)*}\})\) and predict the responses in the usual way \incomment{Following model...} by
  \[
    \hat Y_i = \hat{\alpha}_0 + \sum_{j=1}^p \hat{\beta}_j X_i(\hat{t}_j), \quad i=1,\dots, n'.
  \]
  The choice of a specific summary statistic results in a veiled assumption of an underlying loss function between the estimated and real parameters. In general, the mean is more sensitive to outliers while the median is more robust, but the latter assumes a \(L^1\)-type loss function. On the other hand, the mode is also a good candidate because it represents the point of highest probability. At any rate, these decisions are strongly dependent on several factors such as the skewness or the number of modes in the resulting posterior distribution, and thus should be made on a case-by-case basis.
  \item[Distributional estimates] We can also look at the approximate posterior distribution as a whole and compute the distribution of the ``sampled responses'' at each step of the chain following model~\eqref{eq:rkhs-model-linear-2}:
  \[
  Y^{(m)*} := \left\{Y_i^{(m)*} \equiv Y_i \mid X_i, \theta^{(m)*}:\ i=1,\dots,n'\right\}, \quad m=1,\dots,M.
  \]
  Then, we can take the mean of all such samples as a proxy for each response variable:
  \[
  \hat Y_i = \frac{1}{M}\sum_{m=1}^M Y_i^{(m)*}, \quad i=1,\dots,n'.
  \]
  \item[Variable selection estimates] Lastly, we can focus only on the marginal posterior distribution of \(\tau\mid\mathcal D_n\) and perform variable selection via a point-estimate statistic \(T\). Specifically, we can consider the times \(\hat t_j = T(\{t_j^{(m)*}\})\) and reduce the original data set to the scalar variables \(\{X_i(\hat t_j):\ i=1, \dots,n, \ j=1,\dots,p\}\). After this selection, we can treat the problem as a finite-dimensional regression task and use any of the well-known multivariate algorithms suited for this situation.

Note that these estimators can be obtained all at once after only one round of training (that is, an individual MCMC run to approximate the posterior distribution). As a consequence, what we have in practice is a single algorithm that can produce multiple estimators at the same computational cost, so that any of them can be chosen (or even switched back and forth) depending on the particularities of the problem at hand. Moreover, one could even contemplate an \textit{ensemble model} in which some kind of aggregation of several of the available estimators is performed to produce a final result.

  En \citet[Sec.~2.5]{grollemund2019bayesian}, los autores proponen un estimador Bayesiano para sus funciones ``escalón'' \(\beta_\theta(t)\) utilizando una pérdida cuadrática, de la forma:
  \[
    \hat \beta \in \arg\min_{d\in L^2[0, 1]} \int\int (\beta_\theta(t) - d(t))^2 \pi(\theta\mid \mathcal D_n)\, dt\, d\theta.
  \]
  ¿Podríamos hacer nosotros algo parecido con nuestro parámetro funcional \(\alpha\)?

\subsection{Functional logistic regression}\label{sec:rkhs-logistic-model}

In the case of functional logistic regression, we can view the binary response variable \(Y\in\{0, 1\}\) as a Bernoulli random variable given the regressor \(X=x \in L^2[0, 1]\), and suppose that \(\log\left(p(x)/(1-p(x))\right)\) is linear in \(x\), where \(p(x)=\mathbb P(Y=1\mid X=x)\). Then, an RKHS approach given by the following functional logistic equation:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:rkhs-model-logistic}
  \mathbb P(Y=1 \mid X) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp\{-\alpha_0 - \Psi_X(\alpha)\}}, \quad \alpha \in \Hcal_{0,p}(K).
\end{equation}
Following our previous strategy, after incorporating the sample information we can rewrite the classification model~\eqref{eq:rkhs-model-logistic} as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:rkhs-model-logistic-2}
Y_i \mid X_i,\theta \ \stackrel{\text{i.i.d.}}{\sim} \operatorname{Bernoulli}(p_i), \quad i=1,\dots, n,
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}\label{eq:rkhs-model-logistic-2-parameter}
  p_i = \mathbb P(Y_i=1 \mid X_i,\theta) = \frac{1}{\displaystyle 1 + \exp\left\{-\alpha_0 - \sum_{j=1}^p \beta_j X_i(t_j)\right\}}, \quad i=1,\dots, n,
\end{equation}
where in turn \(\beta_j\in\R\), \(t_j\in[0, 1]\) and \(\alpha_0\in\R\).

In much the same way as the functional linear regression model explained in the previous section, this RKHS-based logistic regression model partially solves some of the issues with the \(L^2\)-model~\eqref{eq:l2-logistic-model} stated in Section~\ref{sec:intro}. Moreover, it negates the problem of non-existence of the MLE in the functional case, since our proposed model is finite-dimensional\footnote{Even in finite-dimensional settings there are cases of quasi-complete separation in which the MLE does not exist. However, this problem can be easily circumvented using, for example, Firth's corrected estimator \citep{firth1993bias}.}. Additionally, under specific conditions this model also entails the logistic \(L^2\)-model in the Gaussian homoscedastic case \citep[see][Th.~1]{berrendero2021functional}.

\begin{comment}
  The proposed model holds whenever \(X_0\), \(X_1\) are homoscedastic Gaussian processes (Bueno-Larraz et al.).
\end{comment}

As far as prior distributions go, we propose to use the same ones as we did in~\eqref{eq:prior-linear} for the regression approach \incomment{Me gustaría probar con otras distribuciones a priori, especialmente para los coeficientes \(\beta\), ya que aquí no sé si tiene tanto sentido mantener \(\sigma^2\) como parámetro y usar el prior de Zellner. ¿Sabéis de alguna que se use en el caso de regresión logística?}. However, in this case the parameter \(\sigma^2\) is a nuisance parameter and can be safely ignored at the end, since it does not appear in the final model~\eqref{eq:rkhs-model-logistic-2}.

\begin{comment}
  Misma pregunta que antes: ¿ponemos la expresión de la posteriori?
  \begin{align*}
\log \pi(\beta, \tau, \alpha_0, \log\sigma\mid \mathcal D_n) & \propto \sum_{i=1}^n \left[ \left(\alpha_0 + \Psi_{x_i}(\alpha)\right)y_i - \log\left(1 + \exp\left\{\alpha_0 + \Psi_{x_i}(\alpha)\right\}\right)\right]\\
\quad &+ \frac{1}{2}\log |G_\tau| - p\log \sigma -\frac{1}{2g\sigma^2} (\beta - b_0)'G_\tau(\beta - b_0).
\end{align*}

\end{comment}

Another thing to consider is that in this case we are approximating a probability, so before producing an output we need to transform the predicted values to \(\{0, 1\}\). We will follow the standard convention of considering a threshold \(\gamma = 0.5\) and predicting \(\hat Y=1\) if and only if \(\mathbb P(Y=1\mid X) \geq \gamma\). With this thresholding strategy in mind, the point estimation approach is analogous to the linear regression case:
\[
\hat Y_i = \mathbb I \left( \left[\displaystyle 1 + \exp\left\{-\hat\alpha_0 - \sum_{j=1}^p \hat\beta_j X_i(\hat t_j)\right\}\right]^{-1} \geq \gamma \right), \quad i=1,\dots,n',
\]
where \(\mathbb I\) is the indicator function. The hat estimates are again obtained through a summary statistic of the corresponding marginal posterior distributions.

On the other hand, the distributional estimates are somewhat different now, since there is the question of which response (the Bernoulli variables in~\eqref{eq:rkhs-model-logistic-2} or the raw probabilities in~\eqref{eq:rkhs-model-logistic-2-parameter}) to consider when averaging the posterior samples:
\begin{description}
  \item[Average sampled probability] If we choose to average the sampled probabilities \(p_i^{(m)*} = \mathbb P(Y_i =1 \mid X_i,\theta^{(m)*})\), we get the following estimator:
  \[
    \hat Y_i = \mathbb I\left(\frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M p_i^{(m)*} \geq \gamma\right), \quad i=1,\dots,n'.
  \]
  \item[Sampled majority vote] If we choose to average the sampled binary responses \(Y^{(m)*}\) instead, we compute the predictions as
\[
  \hat Y_i = \mathbb I\left(\frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M Y_i^{(m)*} \geq \gamma\right), \quad i=1,\dots,n',
\]
where each \(Y_i^{(m)*}\) follows a Bernoulli distribution of parameter \(p_i^{(m)*}\), for \(m=1,\dots,M\).
\end{description}

Lastly, the variable selection method is essentially the same as in the case of linear regression: we select \(p\) times from each trajectory based on the posterior distribution of \(\tau\mid \mathcal D_n\), and then feed the reduced dataset to a multivariate binary classification procedure.

\subsection{Model choice and validation}\label{sec:model-choice}

\begin{comment}
  Distancia máxima a la que puede estar una función de \(H_0,p\) de otra de \(H\)? O de \(H_0\)?
\end{comment}

One of the key decisions in our Bayesian modeling scheme was whether to consider the number of components \(p\) as a member or the parameter space and integrate it into the model. While theoretically we could impose a prior distribution on \(p\) as well, we found that it would have some unwanted practical implications. For instance, it would make the implementation more complex, since the dimensionality of the parameters \(\beta\) and \(\tau\) would need to be fixed at a certain maximum value, but in the MCMC algorithm the working value of \(p\) would vary from one iteration to the next. In this case we would face a label switching issue \citep[c.f.][Sec.~2.3]{grollemund2019bayesian}, as we would have no way of knowing which set of parameters is ``active'' at any given time. Another possibility would be to adapt a purely Bayesian model selection technique \citep[see][Ch.~7]{piironen2017comparison, gelman1995bayesian} to our framework, or even derive some model aggregation methods to combine the posterior distributions obtained for different-sized models. In the end, for the sake of simplicity we decided to let \(p\) be an hyperparameter, so that we could use any model selection criteria (e.g. BIC, DIC, \ldots) to select its optimal value \incomment{deberíamos elegir uno de los criterios?}.

As for the default values of the rest of hyperparameters in~\eqref{eq:prior-linear}, several comments can be made:
\begin{itemize}
  \item For the expected value \(b_0\) we propose to use (an approximation of) the MLE of \(\beta\) (see Section~\ref{sec:results} for details on the implementation) \incomment{La función de verosimilitud es complicada... pero nos basta con una aproximación como punto de partida}. Our numerical studies showed that the results were much better with this choice than, say, with a random or null vector.
  \item We found that the parameter \(g\) does not have as much influence on the final result, and the experimentation suggests that \(g=5\) is a good value.
  \item Lastly, we observed that the choice of \(\eta\) can have a considerable impact on the final estimator. That is why, in an effort to normalize its scale, we consider a compound parameter \(\eta = \tilde \eta \lambda_{\max}(G_\tau)\), where \(\lambda_{\max}(G_\tau)\) is the largest eigenvalue of the matrix \(G_\tau\) and \(\tilde\eta > 0\) is the actual tuning parameter. This standardization technique has been used previously in the literature; see for example \citet{grollemund2019bayesian}.
\end{itemize}

To conclude this section, it is worth mentioning that the Bayesian aspects of our model allow us to perform some model validation checks straight away. For example, we can derive credible intervals for each of the parameters, and in the case of linear regression, we can use the sampled values of \(\sigma^2\) as a measure of the uncertainty of the predictions. Moreover, we can perform various \textit{visual checks}, such as a plot comparing both the observed and posterior predictive distribution of the responses, or a diagram showing the distribution of some statistic \(T(Y^*)\) of the posterior predictive distribution (see Figure~\ref{fig:ppc}) \incomment{conseguir mejor calidad de la figura}. In addition, we can calculate the so-called \textit{Bayesian p-values} for several statistics, which are defined as \(P(T(Y^*)\leq T(Y)\mid Y)\), and are computed by simply measuring the proportion of generated samples \(\{T(Y^{(m)*})\}\) that fall below the real value of the statistic. They are expected to be around 0.5 when the model accurately represents the data \citep[see][Ch.~6]{gelman1995bayesian}.
