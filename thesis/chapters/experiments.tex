\begin{outcomment}
  Incluir figuras de los datasets, y en general repasar las figuras del notebook.

  Enlazar al github, y comentar que hay demos en jupyter.

  - Note that the use of MCMC algorithms introduces a source of stochasticity in the prediction procedure.

  - Ejemplo en RKHS con p=3 y 2 componentes subyacentes: mostrar todas las gráficas (+ppc).

  - Ejemplo dejando todo constante y aumentando \(p\). Quizás también otro variando el tamaño del grid y/o el número de ejemplos de entrenamiento? Bidimensional en ntrain/ngrid?
